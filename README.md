# Experimental browser extension

Securely connect to Vega dapps and sign transactions from your browser.

This is an experimental release for test purposes only and is in active development. You should only transfer funds you are willing to lose to keys that are managed by the extension.

Installing the extension injects a Vega API for dapps and websites to interact with keys and send transactions to the Vega network. Connecting to the wallet and sending any transaction require explicit user approval.

**Understand the risks before you start**

- You retain custody of your assets
- You are responsible for the security of your assets
- You should never share your private keys, recovery phrase or password
- You may encounter bugs, loss of functionality or loss of assets using the software
- No party accepts any liability for any losses whatsoever relating to its use

By using the Vega Wallet, you acknowledge that you have read and understood the [Vega Wallet User Data Policy â†—](https://vega.xyz/vega-wallet-user-data-policy/)

## Installation

Only one extension should be installed at a time to avoid version conflict. Updates may wipe all data, and keys are not recoverable. If you are communicating with multiple networks, consider using multiple browser profiles.

1. Download a release from [Github Releases](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vegawallet-browser/releases) for the network you are testing 
2. Follow the installation guide below based on the browser you are using:

**Chrome users**

1. Unzip the file
2. Add the extension by following this guide: [Load unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked)

**Firefox users**
1. Install the [Firefox Browser Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/developer/)
2. Open Firefox developer edition
3. Enter "about:config" in the URL bar. You'll be asked to accept the risk and continue
4. Search for "xpinstall.signatures.required" and set to false
5. Now enter "about:addons" in the URL bar
6. From the settings cog drop down, select to install add-on from file and select your downloaded zip file
7. You will need to accept a warning message to add an unverified extension
8. Finally, you'll accept a "Vega wallet was added" message. Installation is then complete and you can pin to toolbar from your extension menu for easy access

## Usage

The end-user API is available after `window.onload` and has the following
methods exposed on `window`/`globalThis`:

- `await vega.connectWallet()`
- `await vega.disconnectWallet()`
- `await vega.getChainId()`
- `await vega.listKeys()`
- `await vega.sendTransaction({ publicKey, transaction, sendingMode })`

A sample dApp is provided in [examples/sample-dapp/index.html](./examples/sample-dapp/index.html), and is also
published to Github Pages - [see the live demo](https://vegaprotocol.github.io/vegawallet-browser/).

Alternatively, end-users can also communicate with the content script directly
using JSON-RPC:

```js
window.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
  // somehow avoid catching own message

  const response = event.data

  if (response.error) return console.error(response.error)

  console.log(response.result)
})

window.postMessage(
  {
    jsonrpc: '2.0',
    id: '1',
    method: 'vega.sendTransaction',
    params: { type, tx }
  },
  '*'
)
```

## Structure

The project is built with `webpack`, `create-react-app` and `craco`:

### Development + building

- `build`: Builds the extension in production mode for both chrome and firefox. Outputs to `build/[BROWSER]`.
- `dev:chrome` / `dev:firefox`: Serves the `build/[BROWSER]` directory to develop against the extension. First run `build:[BROWSER]` to build the extension _before_ running this command.
- `format` / `lint`: Formats / lints the source code
- `watch` Watch for changes in the source code and rebuild the extension in development mode for both firefox and chrome. Can be used with `dev:chrome` / `dev:firefox` to automatically reload the extension when changes are made.

### Testing

- `test:frontend` Runs the unit tests on UI components
- `test:backend` Runs the unit tests on the backend
- `test:e2e:chrome` Runs the e2e tests through `selenium` on Chrome (headed)
- `test:e2e:chrome:ci` Runs the e2e tests through `selenium` on Chrome (headless)
- `test:e2e:firefox` Runs the e2e tests through `selenium` on firefox
- `test:e2e:firefox:ci` Runs the e2e tests through `selenium` on firefox (headless)

The web extension source code lives in `web-extension/common` with platform
specific artifacts in respectively `web-extension/firefox` and `web-extension/chrome`. All UI components exist in the `frontend` directory.

The web extension has 4 components:

- `index.html` / `index.tsx`: This is the source code for the extension popup, rendered using `react`.
- `background.js`: This is the background script that handles all core logic
- `content-script.js`: This script intermediates communication between the web
  page and the background script
- `in-page.js`: This script is injected in the web page to provide a
  higher-level, promise-based API for end-users

### Running the extension

To run the extension, first build it using `NODE_ENV=production yarn build:[NETWORK]` and then load it into chrome or firefox.

For chrome follow [the instructions here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked), the directory you need to select after pressing load unpacked should be `./build/chrome`.

For firefox follow [the instructions here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension#installing), the directory you need to select after pressing the "load temporary addon" button should be `./build/firefox`.
