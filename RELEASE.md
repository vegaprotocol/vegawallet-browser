# Release

The release process is done automatically whenever a new tag is pushed, as part of the github workflow. To create a new release, you will need to:

1. `git checkout main` (make sure you're on the main branch)
2. bump the version in the `libs/wallet-web/package.json` to match the desired release version
3. `git add . && git commit -m 'chore: update version'` (commit your changes)
4. `git tag v*.*.*` (create a new tag with the desired version)
5. `git push origin v*.*.*` (push the new tag you've just created)

The description for the release will be automatically generated by the [conventional-changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog) library, which will parse the HEAD since the latest release, and generate an output based on the commit history.
