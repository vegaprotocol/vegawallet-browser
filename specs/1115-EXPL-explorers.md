# Explorers

As a user when I see a reference to a Vega entity I want it to link to the Vega Block explorer so that I can explore more details about it.

As a user when I see a reference to an Ethereum entity I want it to link to the Ethereum Block explorer so that I can explore more details about it.

## Ethereum

- When I see the Ethereum key I can see a link to an Ethereum block explorer based on that address (<a name="1115-EXPL-001" href="#1115-EXPL-001">1115-EXPL-001</a>)

<!-- Contracts -->

<!-- Tokens -->

## Vega

- When I can see the market id I can see a link to the Vega block explorer for the market (<a name="1115-EXPL-002" href="#1115-EXPL-002">1115-EXPL-002</a>)
- When I see a party id I can see a link to the party on the Vega block explorer (<a name="1115-EXPL-003" href="#1115-EXPL-003">1115-EXPL-003</a>)
