# Keep alive

As a browser wallet user, I want the wallet to 'keep alive' so I do not have to repeatedly log in over short periods to trade

- If I do not interact with browser wallet for five minutes I remain logged in to the wallet (<a name="1133-KPAL-001" href="#1133-KPAL-001">1133-KPAL-001</a>)
