## Transaction views

As a user I want to understand my transaction so that I can know what I am sending to the network. e.g. price is based on the asset or position decimals which can make this look inflated or incorrect if I do not understand the internals of Vega.

### Shared

- I can see a receipt like view on the transaction confirmation screen if one is present (<a name="1122-TSHR-001" href="#1122-TSHR-001">1122-TSHR-001</a>)
