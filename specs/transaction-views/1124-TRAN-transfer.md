### One off Transfers

- I can see the receiving key of the transfer (<a name="1124-TRAN-001" href="#1124-TRAN-001">1124-TRAN-001</a>)
- For a oneOff transfer which has a delivery date in the past there is a way to see that the transfer will be executed immediately (<a name="1124-TRAN-002" href="#1124-TRAN-002">1124-TRAN-002</a>)
- For a oneOff transfer which has a delivery date in the future there is a way to see when the transfer will be delivered (<a name="1124-TRAN-003" href="#1124-TRAN-003">1124-TRAN-003</a>)
- I can see the amount of the asset being transferred (<a name="1124-TRAN-004" href="#1124-TRAN-004">1124-TRAN-004</a>)
