# Resilience Tests

### What do we test here?
These tests aim to verify the resilience of the browser wallet when faced with dependency failures, such as a complete network outage or unavailability of an external API endpoint. The objective is to ensure that the browser wallet remains stable in such scenariosâ€”it should not crash but rather display relevant errors and continue functioning without interruption

## Essential setup  
You will need selenium webdriver installed. Follow setup instructions [here](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/run-selenium-tests-using-selenium-chromedriver).
  

### Running the tests
Build the wallet  
`yarn build:test-e2e`

Run using the following command  
`yarn test:resillience`
